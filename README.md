A python script to create a csv file containing the top grossing movies of any year from IMDB with the keywords associated with each movie.

In my source code I have mentioned year as 2014. You can select year of your choice by just doing a small editing in the source code of the script.

For running this script in your system you have to install python 3.4 version.

Also you have to install 'requests', 'beautifulsoup4' and csv modules for python 3.4 version to run this script.

For installing the module use the following command---
>python -m pip install modulename


For running the script use the following command---
>python filename.py


So, go ahead and have a look of top grossing movies of any year you want in your csv file by simply running a python script instead of going to google and each time searching for that.
